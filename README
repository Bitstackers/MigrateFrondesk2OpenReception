#To get the calendar information an firebird server must be running.
#Check the run.sh for correct settings for the firebird connecting.
#For extracting information out of that, there is made a couple of scripts which outputs the table where each column gets its own file, that is line seperated.
#The data comes out in Western Europe 8852-1 encoding, so the command to convert every file in a folder is saved in the file "utf8Encode.sh". DON'T try to run the file, without first reading what it does!!
#Last update the migrate program so it reads the right files.

#Remarks
The pub package CsvParser need a change to work, because it throws "unexpected empty line" for no apparent reason.
